In our proposed system, we get the text-based message from the user and convert the message into Hexadecimal code and the Message is split into parts, one is used as a message another one is used as a key, the XOR operation is performed for the purposes of high compression factor. DNA digital coding is applied over the message and gets the DNA base coded message. 

Basic idea is to store the message between two clients on the server in an encrpted form.
